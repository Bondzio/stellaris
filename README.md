# stellaris
+ auto survey at start
+ all FTL methods discoverable
+ more complex solar systems
+ systems with 2, 3, or more stars
+ randomized angles of planets in prescripted systems
+ choice to automate any part of gameplay when desired
	+ choice of tech
	+ fleet construction
	+ sector suggestions
+ all colonizable planets have 25 tiles
	+  or, tile arrangements less painful to look at:
	24: 4x6, 5x4+4
	23: 4+3x5+4
	22: 5+6x2+5
	21: 3+5x3+3
+ more common terraforming candidate
	+ or, later tech that allows more terraforming flexibility
+ no debris or better interface
+ less  intrusive labels
+ freer camera angles & zooming
+ ability to zoom out into galaxy view and zoom into star systems
+ fewer notifications, easy way to clear them, turn off that damned ping
+ migrant fleet that plays more like a usual empire
+ influence is stupid
+ less restriction: do whatever you want whenever you want (break truce, break trade, etc) but with consequences
+ fewer mutexes on policy/ethos/traits.
	+ for example, the way it's set up, cylon revolt can't take place
+ commandeering or requesting use of other nations' wormhole generators
+ color-coded pop icons
+ immediately build highest level building available
+ view construction and order queues as lists, manipulate, drag/drop
+ instead of decreasing happiness on less habitable planets, decrease number of max pops
+ more galaxy sizes and shapes
+ change that unpleasant skull icon
+ separate name lists by country
+ in war declaration screen, list every planet only once, dropdown with cede/liberate/cleanse choices
+ research penalty from having more planets and pops makes no sense
+ no building resource suppression: instead, have bonuses if building matches resource
+ more diversity in planets/gas giants/stars:
	+ ice giant
	+ modifable rotational axis (rings of Uranus?)
	+ tidally locked planets shouldn't spin, should have side-specific appearances, and only be habitable in the middle tile column
+ default sector settings
+ upgradable event ships
